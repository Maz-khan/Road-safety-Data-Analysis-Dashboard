# Road-safety-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

 ## Introduction
   This project focuses on analyzing road safety data to identify patterns and factors contributing to accidents. I developed a Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and derive actionable insights.



 ## Objectives
- Analyze accident data for trends and patterns
- Visualize KPIs such as Accident Severity, Weather, Road Surface, etc.
- Provide insights for improving road safety measures

 ## Data Sources
   Dataset: Road accident dataset containing fields like Accident Date, Severity, Junction Control, Weather Conditions, Road Surface Conditions, etc.
Tools Used: Microsoft Power BI

 ## Work Done
- Import and clean the dataset in Power BI.
- Create calculated columns according to KPIs (Data Processing).
- Group some column like (Junction Control, Road Surface, Weather Control).
- Build visuals according to the dataset.

 ## Insights
- Accident Severity Distribution: Most accidents are Slight, but fatalities account for 41K.
- Accidents Over Time: Accidents peaked in November Month.
- Day of the Week: Highest accidents occur on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
- Junction Controls: Not a junction and T/Staggered/Other Junction contributed most of          the accidents.
- Weather Conditions: Accidents are higher during Fine weather conditions.
- Road Surface Conditions: Dry roads are highly correlated with severe accidents.

 ## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into accident trends and highlights critical factors contributing to road safety issues. Authorities can use this dashboard for targeted safety interventions.
